:::

### CHANGES

* serviceregistration/kubernetes: labels use `openbao` as prefix instead of `vault`. [[GH-416](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/416)]

### IMPROVEMENTS

* core: Update Go to 1.22.6 [[GH-504](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/504)]

### BUG FIXES

* cli: Always pass `BAO_ADDR` to the token helper, so the token helper can know
the address even if it was provided through the `-address` flag. For
compatibility we also set `VAULT_ADDR`. [[GH-348](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/348)]
* docker: fix collision between the cluster address and local JSON configuration sharing the same variable within the docker-entrypoint script [[GH-446](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/446)]
* secrets/pki: Fix handling of reusing existing Ed25519 keys [[GH-461](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/461)]
